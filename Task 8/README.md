**Title**  
Responsive Cards with Clean, Well-Formatted CSS

**Questions / Description**  
Design informational cards with consistent spacing, typography, and professional CSS formatting.

**Aim**  
Demonstrate maintainable CSS style (sections, comments, utilities, components).

**Step by Step Procedure**  
1. Build 3–6 info cards in `index.html`.  
2. Group CSS into sections (Tokens, Base, Layout, Components).  
3. Use utilities (e.g., `.muted`, `.card`, `.btn`) to avoid repetition.  
4. Ensure responsive behavior with a grid and media queries.

**Explanation of Concepts**  
- Code organization improves readability.  
- Utility vs component classes.  
- Typography scale and spacing system.

**Answers**  
Expected: clean cards, no overlaps, readable on mobile, well-commented CSS.

**Files & Hints**  
- Files: `index.html`, `styles.css`  
- Hints: Keep selectors shallow; avoid `!important`.

**Viva Questions & Answers**  
1. *BEM?* Block-Element-Modifier naming style.  
2. *Specificity pitfalls?* Overly strong selectors limit reuse.  
3. *Why utilities?* Consistent spacing/typography.  
4. *What is a design token?* Named value for theme.  
5. *How to avoid layout shift?* Fixed aspect or min-heights.

**Outcome**  
A set of tidy, reusable cards and exemplary CSS formatting.
